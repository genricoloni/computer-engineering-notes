## Computer-based systems

Computer-based systems are everywhere, and the services they offer are very diverses. From that, we can easy understand why the **dependability**, which is the ability  of the system to deliver the expected service, is a critical aspect of these systems, in particular in a security point of view.

A system should (or must) be able to deliver the expected service, even in the presence of faults, errors, and **attacks**. This is the main goal of dependability, which is as important as the functionality of the system, pheraps even more. TO achieve that, we have **Formal Methods** that provide to us a set of techniques and tools to design, verify, and validate computer-based systems, in a rigorous and systematic way, even in presence of faults and attacks.
