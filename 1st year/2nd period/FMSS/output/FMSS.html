<h2 id="computer-based-systems">Computer-based systems</h2>
<p>Computer-based systems are everywhere, and the services they offer
are very diverses. From that, we can easy understand why the
<strong>dependability</strong>, which is the ability of the system to
deliver the expected service, is a critical aspect of these systems, in
particular in a security point of view.</p>
<p>A system should (or must) be able to deliver the expected service,
even in the presence of faults, errors, and <strong>attacks</strong>.
This is the main goal of dependability, which is as important as the
functionality of the system, pheraps even more. TO achieve that, we have
<strong>Formal Methods</strong> that provide to us a set of techniques
and tools to design, verify, and validate computer-based systems, in a
rigorous and systematic way, even in presence of faults and attacks.</p>
<h1 id="basic-concepts-and-terminology">Basic concepts and
terminology</h1>
<p>All the concept and the terminology that will be presented in this
section derives directly from the paper “Basic Concepts and Taxonomy of
Dependable and Secure Computing” by Avizienis et al. (2004). This paper
is a fundamental reference in the field of dependability and security
and it is the basis for the definition of the concepts and terminology
that will be used in the entire course, as suggested by the
professor.</p>
<h2 id="dependability">Dependability</h2>
<p>We can give to <strong>dependability</strong> a simple definition:
given a system, which is designed to provide a certain service, the
dependability is the ability of that system to deliver the specified
service also in presence of faults and malfunctions. In other words
<em>dependability is that property of a computer-based system such that
reliance can justifiably be placed on the service it delivers</em>. Note
that the latter definition stresses the need for a justified reliance on
the service, which is a key aspect of dependability.</p>
<h3 id="computer-based-systems-1">Computer-based systems</h3>
<p>A computer-based system is a system that includes a certain number of
components: each of them can be interconnected and have its own
functionality. The components can be hardware, software, humans and the
environment in which the system operates.</p>
<figure>

alt="Computer-based system - C. Bernardeschi" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Computer-based system - C.
Bernardeschi</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="faults-and-failures">Faults and Failures</h3>
<p>We call a <strong>failure</strong> the inability of the system to
deliver the expected service, and a <strong>fault</strong> the cause of
that failure.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> if a cash machine delivers the wrong amount
of money, we can say that the system has failed.</p>
<p>A fault causes an <strong>error</strong> in the state of the system,
which lead to a <strong>failure</strong>. A failure can have different
nature, such as physical, logical, human error or even as consequence of
an attack.</p>
<p><strong>Example: Logic Bomb.</strong> It’s a piece of code that is
inserted into a software system that will execute a malicious function
when specified conditions are met.</p>

<p>Computer Faults vs. Other Equipment Faults Computer faults differ
from those of other equipment in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subtler Failures</strong>: computer failures are more subtle
than outright crashes or sudden stops.</li>
<li><strong>Information Storage</strong>: computers store information in
various ways, leading to a multitude of possible errors, both internally
and externally.</li>
<li><strong>Hidden Small Defects, Big Effects</strong>: even small
hidden defects can have significant impacts, especially in digital
systems.</li>
<li><strong>Complex Hierarchies</strong>: computer systems are intricate
hierarchies built upon hidden components.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="achieving-dependability">Achieving Dependability</h3>
<p>The dependability of a system can be achieved going trough a rigorous
and engineered steps. Two main figures are involved, system and software
engineers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>System engineers</strong> are responsible for the design of
the system, and they have to use analysis to model the dependability of
the their design. From these, the software specifications are derived,
and the possible changes to the system are evaluated, in order to
accomodate software limitations;</li>
<li><strong>Software engineers</strong> are responsible for the
implementation of the software, and they have to use the specifications
to develop the software, and to test it in order to verify that it meets
the requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, it’s crucial to understand that <strong>dependability is
not something that can be added to a system as an afterthought</strong>.
It must be considered from the very beginning of the design process, and
it must be an integral part of the system, wusing a scientific and
engineering approach.</p>
<h2 id="the-system-entity">The <em>system</em> entity</h2>
<p>A simple but effective definition of a system is the following: a
system is a entity that interacts with the environment and other
systems; its boundaries are the common frontier between the system and
the environment.</p>
<h3 id="systems-properties">System’s properties</h3>
<p>A system has a <strong>function</strong>, which is the service that
it provides to the environment, and it’s described by its own functional
specification. It also has a <strong>behavior</strong>, visualized as
the sequence of states that the system goes through during its
operation, and it’s how the system implements its function. Then there
is the <strong>structure</strong>, which is the way the system is
organized, and it’s described by its own structural specification.</p>
<p>From the user point of view, the system has a <strong>delivered
service</strong>, which is the result of the interaction between the
user and the system, that is the behavior of the system as perceived by
the user. Obviously, the user can be seen as another system that
interacts with the system under consideration.</p>
<h3 id="systems-requirements">System’s requirements</h3>
<p>First of all, we need to define the problem that the system has to
solve, and then we have to define the requirements that the system has
to meet, and then we have to define both functional and dependability
requirements. Pay attention to the difference between the system’s
function and the system’s specification: the former is the service that
the system provides, while the latter is the solution implemented to
provide that service. In the end, we define the
<strong>correctness</strong> of the system, which is the ability of the
system to deliver the specified service.</p>
<h2 id="dependability-tree">Dependability tree</h2>
<p>Take in consideration the following dependability tree:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/01/dependability%20tree.png" width="500"
alt="Dependability tree - Avizienis et al., 2004" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Dependability tree - Avizienis et al.,
2004</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="threats-to-dependability">Threats to dependability</h3>
<p>As we said before, a <strong>correct service</strong> is delivered if
the service is delivered in accordance with the system’s specification.
When this doesn’t happen, we have a <strong>service failure</strong>,
which is one the possible states of the system:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/01/states.png" width="500"
alt="Service failure - C. Bernardeschi" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Service failure - C.
Bernardeschi</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We call <strong>service outage</strong> the period during which the
system is not able to deliver the service, a <strong>service
degradation</strong> the period during which the system delivers a
service that is not in accordance with the specification, such as a
subset of the services. We also recall the <strong>chain of
threats</strong> to dependability: <strong>faults</strong> causes
<strong>errors</strong>, which lead to <strong>failures</strong>: note
that many errors don’t cause failures because they don’t reach the
external state of the system.</p>
<p>Faults can be <strong>dormant</strong>, that is they are present in
the system but they don’t cause errors, and <strong>active</strong>,
that is they cause errors, and thay can be <strong>external</strong> or
<strong>internal</strong>: from the latter we can extract the definition
of <strong>vulnerability</strong>, which is the property of the system
that allows an external agent to cause a fault.</p>
<p><strong>Example: Trapdoor.</strong> It’s a hidden entry within a
system that allows an attacker to bypass security measures.</p>

<p>From the past example we can learn that, having in mind the
dependability tree, to achieve security only the authorized actions have
to be allowed, and the confidentiality and the integrity of the data
have appears in case of improper or unauthorized actions.</p>
<h3 id="dependability-attributes">Dependability attributes</h3>
<p>The dependability of a system can be described by a set of
attributes, measurable and quantifiable in terms of probabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Availability</strong>: the readiness for correct
service;</li>
<li><strong>Reliability</strong>: the continuity of correct
service;</li>
<li><strong>Safety</strong>: the absence of catastrophic consequences on
the user and the environment;</li>
<li><strong>Confidentiality</strong>: the absence of unauthorized
disclosure of information;</li>
<li><strong>Integrity</strong>: the absence of improper system state
alterations;</li>
<li><strong>Maintainability</strong>: the ability to undergo
modifications and repairs.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also briefly present the concept of <strong>trust</strong> between
systems, that express the dependance of dependability of the system A
from the dependability of the system B.</p>
<p>From them, we can gave a new definition of dependability, based on
the frequency of the service failures:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dependability is the ability of the system to deliver the service in
accordance with the specification, avoiding that service failures occur
with a frequency that is greater than a certain threshold.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The threshold should be derived from the system requirements, and
should consider frequency, duration and severity of the service
failures.</p>
<h2 id="taxonomy-of-faults">Taxonomy of faults</h2>
<h3 id="the-system-life-cycle">The system life cycle</h3>
<p>We define the <strong>system life cycle</strong> as the period of
time that starts from the conception of the system and continues until
the system is decommissioned. We’re going to consider only two phases of
the system life cycle: the <strong>development phase</strong>, during
which the system is designed and implemented, and the <strong>use
phase</strong>, during which the system is used to deliver the
service.</p>
<h4 id="development-phase">Development phase</h4>
<p>In this phase the system only interact with the <strong>development
environment</strong>, such as physical world, human developers, their
tools and possible facilities: in this phase development faults can be
introduced in the system.</p>
<h4 id="use-phase">Use phase</h4>
<p>In this phase the system interacts with the <strong>use
environment</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Physical environment</strong>: the system is subject to
physical stress, such as temperature, humidity, vibrations, etc;</li>
<li><strong>administrator</strong>: who manages the system;</li>
<li><strong>users</strong>: who interact with the system;</li>
<li><strong>providers</strong>: who delivers the system to the
users;</li>
<li><strong>infrastructure</strong>: everything that is needed to
support the system;</li>
<li><strong>intruders</strong>: who try to attack the system.</li>
</ul>
<p>The use phase alternates period of <strong>correct delivery</strong>
of the service, <strong>service outage</strong> and <strong>service
shutdown</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>service outage</strong>: when the system has a service
failure, and it’s not able to deliver the service correctly;</li>
<li><strong>service shutdown</strong>: when the system is stopped for
maintenance or for other reasons. Note that maintenance may take place
during every period of time, and includes both repair and
modification.</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, there is a taxonomy for the maintenance: if the system is
stopped for repair an active fault, then we have a <strong>corrective
maintenance</strong>; if the system is stopped for repair a dormant
fault, then we have a <strong>preventive maintenance</strong>; if the
system is stopped for modification, then we have an <strong>adaptive
maintenance</strong>, or <strong>augmentative maintenance</strong> if
the system is stopped for improvement.</p>
<p>$$</p>
<h3 id="faults-classification">Faults classification</h3>
<p>Given the fact that faults can’t be enumerated, it’s useful to
classify them in order to understand their nature and their effects,
because we can also identify the mechanisms that can be used to prevent
that specific class of faults.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/01/fault%20classification.png" width="400"
alt="Faults classification - Avizienis et al., 2004" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Faults classification - Avizienis et al.,
2004</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We identifies three main classes of faults:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>development faults</strong>: faults that are introduced
during the development phase;</li>
<li><strong>physical faults</strong>: faults that affect the physical
components of the system;</li>
<li><strong>interaction faults</strong>: faults that includes all the
external faults.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overlapping classes are possible, so we’re able to identify 31
possible combinations of faults.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/01/fault%20combinations.png" width="400"
alt="Faults classification - Avizienis et al., 2004" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Faults classification - Avizienis et al.,
2004</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We’re going to analyze the most important classes of faults, having
in mind the previous figure.</p>
<h4 id="natural-faults">Natural faults</h4>
<p>They’re the faults numbered from <span
class="math inline">\(11\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(15\)</span> in the previous figure, and they’re
are mainly hardware faults caused by natural phenomena, without the
intervention of humans.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Production defect</strong>, <span
class="math inline">\(11\)</span>: a fault that is introduced during the
development;</li>
<li><strong>internal defect</strong>, <span class="math inline">\(12
\text{ and } 13\)</span>: a fault that is introduced during the use
phase, and it’s caused by the physical degradation of the
components;</li>
<li><strong>external defect</strong>, <span class="math inline">\(14
\text{ and } 15\)</span>: a fault that is introduced during the use
phase, and it’s caused by the physical stress of the environment,
outside the system boundaries.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="human-made-faults">Human-made faults</h4>
<p>We can distinguish between <strong>malicious faults</strong>,
introduced with the intent to harm the system, and <strong>non-malicious
faults</strong>, introduced without any malicious intent.</p>
<p>The formers have as a goal to harm the system, the latter are divided
in two more classes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>non-deliberate faults</strong>: faults that are introduced
as human errors (<span class="math inline">\(1 \text{, } 2 \text{, } 7
\text{, } 8 \text{, } 16 \text{-}18 \text{, }
26\text{-}28\)</span>);</li>
<li><strong>deliberate faults</strong>: faults that are introduced as a
consequence of a deliberate action, such as a bad decision (<span
class="math inline">\(3 \text{, } 4 \text{, } 9 \text{, } 10 \text{, }
19 \text{-}21 \text{, } 29\text{-}31\)</span>).</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter can be introduced during <strong>development</strong> or
by <strong>interaction</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>deliberate development faults</strong>: are generally the
result of a trade-off, both in terms of performance and economy (<span
class="math inline">\(3 \text{, } 4 \text{, } 9 \text{, }
10\)</span>);</li>
<li><strong>deliberate interaction faults</strong>: when operational
procedures are deliberately violated (<span class="math inline">\(19
\text{-}21 \text{, } 29\text{-}31\)</span>).</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, <strong>deliberate faults</strong> shows up only after an
unacceptable behavior of the system, and it can be difficult to realize
the actual faults because, when it happened, who introduced the fault
can be not conscious of the consequences of his action.</p>
<p>However, not all mistakes and dab decisions by non-malicious humans
are accidental: we can distinguish between <strong>accidental
faults</strong> and <strong>incompetence faults</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="interaction-faults">Interaction faults</h4>
<p>They can also be named as <strong>operational faults</strong>, given
the fact that they occour during the use phase, and they’re all
external, because they’re caused by the interaction between the system
and the environment. Classes from <span
class="math inline">\(16\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(31\)</span> are human made, and only <span
class="math inline">\(14\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(15\)</span> are natural.</p>
<p>A common feature of these faults is the fact that they usually need
the presence of a vulnerability in the system, that is a property of the
system that allows an external agent to cause a fault, both intentional
and unintentional.</p>
<p>Lastly, we recognize the <strong>permanent faults</strong>, that are
continuous and stable, and the <strong>transient faults</strong>, that
are temporary, even for very short periods of time.</p>
<h2 id="failures">Failures</h2>
<p>In order to characterize the failures, we use four different
dimensions, such that each of them can describe a different aspect of
the failure.</p>
<h3 id="failure-domain">Failure domain</h3>
<p>This point of view leads us to distinguish between <strong>content
failures</strong>, that are the result of the system’s inability to
deliver the correct service, and <strong>timing failures</strong>, that
are the result of the system’s inability to deliver the correct service
at the correct time (early, late, or never).</p>
<h3 id="consistency-domain">Consistency domain</h3>
<p>When a system has more than one user, it’s important to understand if
a failure shows up identically for each user, and we call this situation
<strong>consistent failure</strong>, or if the failure shows up
differently for each user, and we call this situation
<strong>inconsistent failure</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="detectability-domain">Detectability domain</h3>
<p>It’s the property of the system to check the correctness of the
service, and it’s the ability of the system to detect the failure. These
mechanisms have two failure modes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>false alarm</strong>: the system detects a failure when
there isn’t;</li>
<li><strong>missed detection</strong>: the system doesn’t detect a
failure when there is.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="consequences-domain">Consequences domain</h3>
<p>Consequences of a failure are divided in two classes, based on their
severity and impact:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>minor failure</strong>: the failure has a similar cost to
the benefit of the service;</li>
<li><strong>catastrophic failure</strong>: the failure has a cost that
is much greater than the benefit of the service.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="criteria-to-evaluate-the-severity-of-a-failure">Criteria to
evaluate the severity of a failure</h3>
<p>We can use the following criteria to evaluate the severity of a
failure:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>availability</strong>: the duration of the service
outage;</li>
<li><strong>safety</strong>: possible loss of life or injury;</li>
<li><strong>confidentiality</strong>: possible unauthorized disclosure
of information;</li>
<li><strong>integrity</strong>: data corruption and/or inability to
recover;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="system-failures">System failures</h3>
<p>When a system has a failure, it is usually caused by different
coexisting faults; we talk about <strong>single fails</strong> if the
failure is caused by a single fault, and <strong>multiple fails</strong>
if the failure is caused by multiple faults. In the latter we can also
divide the faults in <strong>independent</strong> and
<strong>dependent</strong>, respectively if the faults are not related
to each other, and if the faults have a common cause.</p>
<h3 id="dependability-and-security-failures">Dependability and security
failures</h3>
<p>These failures occurs if the system suffers service failures more
frequently than an acceptable threshold; even the specifications of the
system can contain faults:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>omission</strong>: a requirement is not included in the
specification;</li>
<li><strong>unjustified requirements</strong>: choice of requirements
that are not justified by the system’s function, that raises the cost of
the system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Systems can have different type of failures:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>fail-controlled</strong>: the system is designed to fail in
a controlled way, described by the system’s specification;</li>
<li><strong>fail-stopped</strong>: the system in which possible failures
are only <em>haltings</em>;</li>
<li><strong>fail-silent</strong>: the system in which possible failures
are only <em>silents</em>;</li>
<li><strong>fail-safe</strong>: the system in which there are only minor
failures;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="errors">Errors</h2>
<p>As we saw, an error is a part of the system state that is able to
lead to a failure. An error is detected if a signal to indicate its
presence in raised, otherwise the error is undetected and it’s called
<strong>latent error</strong>. It’s not true that every error leads to a
failure, and this depends on:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <strong>structure of the system</strong>, specially the presence
of redundancy;</li>
<li>the <strong>behavior of the system</strong>, for example the part of
the state that contains the error is never reached during the delivery
of the service, then the error is not able to lead to a failure.</li>
</ul>
<p>The classification of the error is done according to the damage
pattern (single, double or triple bit, burst, etc.), and how many
components are affected by the error (single, multiple, etc.).</p>
<h2
id="chain-of-threats---relationship-between-faults-errors-and-failures">Chain
of threats - Relationship between faults, errors and failures</h2>
<p>When systems have to interact with each other, an error propagation
can occur:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/01/chain%20of%20threats.png" width="400"
alt="Chain of threats - Avizienis et al., 2004" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Chain of threats - Avizienis et al.,
2004</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>An <strong>active fault</strong> is when it leads to an error, both
if it’s internal or external, and it can lead to a failure, and a
<strong>fault activation</strong> occurs when a particular input
activates a dormant fault in a specific component. This can also be a
<strong>propagation</strong> between the components, where an error of a
component can lead to an error of another component.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: error propagation</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take a sensor which reports the spinning speed of a turbine. If the
sensor fails and starts to report that the turbine is no longer
spinning, it inject incorrect data (fault) into the control system, that
will send to the turbine the wrong commands, and the turbine could be
damaged (failure).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="dependability-means">Dependability means</h2>
<p>When we talk about dependability means, we refer to the mechanisms
that are used to prevent, detect and tolerate, or in general deal, with
faults.</p>
<h3 id="fault-prevention">Fault prevention</h3>
<p>These techniques are usually related to general system design, and
they’re used to avoid the introduction of faults in the system. They can
be divided in two classes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>development fault prevention</strong>: techniques that are
used to avoid the introduction of faults during the development
phase;</li>
<li><strong>improved development process</strong>: techniques that are
used to improve the development process, such as the use of formal
methods, the use of a rigorous testing and so on.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fault-tolerance">Fault tolerance</h3>
<p>It’s the ability to deal with faults at run-time, and ensure that the
system is able to deliver the service even in presence of faults. There
are a lot of techniques that can be used to achieve fault tolerance, as
we can see in the following figure:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/01/tolerance.png" width="400"
alt="Fault tolerance techniques - Avizienis et al., 2004" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Fault tolerance techniques - Avizienis et
al., 2004</figcaption>
</figure>
<h4 id="error-detection">Error detection</h4>
<p>For simplicity, let’s state that <em>when the error reaches the
boundaries of the systems, then we have a failure</em>. In this context,
the most challenging aspect are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <strong>identification of the error</strong>, that is the
ability to detect the presence of the error;</li>
<li><strong>ensure that status containing the error is never
reached</strong>, that is the ability to avoid that the error leads to a
failure;</li>
<li>the <strong>prevention of the error propagation</strong>, that is
the ability to avoid that the error of a component leads to the error of
another component.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: error detection with two systems</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take two systems, A and B, that should provide the same service. If
they get the same input, then they should provide the same output. If
the outputs are different, then we have a detection of the error, within
the hypothesis that the systems are independent and it’s very unlikely
that they have the same error at the same time.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="error-recovery">Error recovery</h3>
<h4 id="error-compensation">Error compensation</h4>
<p>When we talk about fault tolerance, we’re in fact talking about
<strong>fault masking</strong>: a general method to achieve this goal is
<strong>performing multiple computations</strong> trough replicas, and
then apply a vote mechanism to the results. It’s worth to remember that
hardware faults <strong>fails independently</strong> and, on the
contrary, software faults <strong>fails dependently</strong>: to achieve
a sort of independence, we can use <strong>design diversity</strong>,
that is the use of different design techniques to implement the same
function.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: error compensation with TMR</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take a system that uses a <strong>Triple Modular Redundancy</strong>
(TMR) to achieve fault tolerance. The system has three replicas, and the
output is the result of a majority vote. If one of the replicas fails,
then the output is still correct, because the other two replicas are
still able to provide the correct output.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="organization-of-fault-tolerance">Organization of fault
tolerance</h4>
<p>We can summarize the organization of fault tolerance in the following
figure:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/01/summary.png" width="400"
alt="Organization of fault tolerance - Avizienis et al., 2004" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Organization of fault tolerance -
Avizienis et al., 2004</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>WE just have to add some definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>solid faults</strong> are those that are permanent and their
activation is repeatable;</li>
<li><strong>elusive faults</strong> are those that are permanent and
their activation is not systematically reproducible;</li>
<li><strong>intermittent faults</strong> are those with transient
physical or interaction faults, and their activation is not
systematically reproducible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that the classes of faults that can be actually tolerated
depend on the fault assumption that is being considered in the
development process, and on the independence of the redundant components
that are used to achieve fault tolerance.</p>
