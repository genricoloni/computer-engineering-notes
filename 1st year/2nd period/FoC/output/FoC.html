<h1 id="introduction-to-applied-cryptography">Introduction to applied
cryptography</h1>
<p>Cryptography, or the art of secret writing, has been around for
thousands of years, and get more and more important in our digital
world, because of the need of secure communication and data protection
in every aspect of our lives, such as online banking, e-commerce,
e-mail, and social media, given the inevitable presence of malicious
actors.</p>
<p>These malicious actors are often referred to as adversaries: they are
<strong>intelligent</strong> users, with an <em>objective</em>, and lot
of <strong>resource</strong> and <strong>abilities</strong>. This leads
to an unfair competition between the adversaries and the defenders, also
called the security engineers: the latter have to protect a system
against all possible attacks, having in mind the usage and performance
of the system, and this will be our role in this course.</p>
<p>Luckily, we donâ€™t have to reinvent the wheel: we can use tools and
techniques that have been developed by cryptographers and security
engineers over the years, and we talk about <strong>applied
cryptography</strong> because of this very fact.</p>
<p>Remember these facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cryptography is a <strong>useful</strong> tool, but it is not a
<strong>silver bullet</strong>.</li>
<li>Cryptography is the basis of <strong>security</strong>, but itâ€™s not
the solution to all security problems, and itâ€™s not reliable if not used
properly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="symmetric-encryption">Symmetric Encryption</h2>
<p>Letâ€™s give some context to the usage of cryptography in the real
world.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/01/scheme1.png"
alt="A simple scheme with our main actors" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A simple scheme with our main
actors</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the figure above, we have two main actors: Alice and Bob. They
want to communicate securely, but they are afraid of the presence of an
eavesdropper.</p>
<p>To allow a secure communication, we can use a model, defining the
following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plaintext <em>x</em></strong>: the original message that
Alice wants to send to Bob;</li>
<li><strong>Ciphertext <em>y</em></strong>: the encrypted message that
Alice sends to Bob;</li>
<li><strong>Key <em>k</em></strong>: a shared secret between Alice and
Bob, that is used to encrypt and decrypt the message;</li>
<li><strong>Encryption function <em>E</em></strong>: a function that
takes the plaintext and the key, and returns the ciphertext;</li>
<li><strong>Decryption function <em>D</em></strong>: a function that
takes the ciphertext and the key, and returns the plaintext;</li>
<li><strong>Network</strong>: the insecure communication channel between
Alice and Bob.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the encryption and decryption functions are publicly known,
and the only secret is the key.</p>
<h3 id="the-cipher">The cipher</h3>
<p>We define as <strong>cipher</strong> the triple (<em>K</em>,
<em>P</em>, <em>C</em>) of efficient algorithms (<em>Gen</em>,
<em>Enc</em>, <em>Dec</em>) such that:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Gen</em> is a algorithm <span class="math inline">\(Z^+
\rightarrow K\)</span> that outputs a key;</li>
<li><em>Enc</em> is a algorithm <span class="math inline">\(P \times K
\rightarrow C\)</span> that takes a key and a plaintext, and returns a
ciphertext. An equivalent notations are <span
class="math inline">\(Enc(k, x)\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(E(k, x)\)</span>, or <span
class="math inline">\(E_k(x)\)</span>;</li>
<li><em>Dec</em> is a algorithm <span class="math inline">\(C \times K
\rightarrow P\)</span> that takes a key and a ciphertext, and returns a
plaintext. An equivalent notations are <span
class="math inline">\(Dec(k, y)\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(D(k, y)\)</span>, or <span
class="math inline">\(D_k(y)\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cipher <strong>properties</strong> are also important, and the main
ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Correctness</strong>: for every key <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> and every plaintext <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, it holds that <span
class="math inline">\(D(k, E(k, x)) = p\)</span>;</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: for every key <span
class="math inline">\(k \in K\)</span>, and for every encrypted <span
class="math inline">\(c \in C\)</span>, itâ€™s computationally infeasible
to find both a plaintext <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> such
that <span class="math inline">\(E(k, p) = c\)</span>, without knowing
<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, and the key <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> itself.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="example-mono-alphabetic-substitution">Example: mono-alphabetic
substitution</h4>
<p>A simple example of a cipher is the <strong>mono-alphabetic
substitution</strong>, where each letter of the alphabet is replaced by
another letter, and the key is the mapping between the original and the
substituted letters. The encryption algorithm is implemented by
substituting each letter of the plaintext with the corresponding letter
of the key, and the decryption algorithm is implemented by substituting
each letter of the ciphertext with the corresponding letter of the
inverse key. To break this cipher, we can think of a brute-force attack,
where we try all the possible keys, but this is not feasible because of
the large number of possible keys, which is <span
class="math inline">\(26! \approx 4 \times 10^[26]\)</span>. However,
despite the large number of possible keys, the mono-alphabetic
substitution is not secure, because of the frequency analysis attack,
which is based on the fact that some letters are more frequent than
others in a language, and this can be used to guess the key. From this
example, we can see that the security of a cipher is not only based on
the number of possible keys, but also on the structure of the cipher,
and the security of the key: good ciphers sould hide statistical
properties of the plaintext, and their security mustnâ€™t rely on the
dimensions of the key space.</p>
<h3 id="attacks-overview">Attacks overview</h3>
<p>When we talk about the attack complexity, we refer to the number of
operations that an adversary has to perform to break a cipher, and we
can distinguish between three main types of attacks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ciphertext-only attack</strong>: the adversary has access to
a set of ciphertexts, and he has to find the plaintexts. This is the
weakest type of attack, and itâ€™s often based on the frequency analysis,
or on the knowledge of the structure of the plaintext;</li>
<li><strong>Known-plaintext attack</strong>: the adversary has access to
a set of plaintext-ciphertext pairs, and he has to find the key. This is
a stronger type of attack, and itâ€™s often based on the knowledge of the
structure of the cipher;</li>
<li><strong>Chosen-plaintext attack</strong>: the adversary has access
to a set of plaintexts, and he has to find the key. This is the
strongest type of attack, and itâ€™s often based on the knowledge of the
structure of the cipher, and on the ability to choose the plaintexts. We
can easily see that if a cipher is secure against chosen-plaintext
attacks, then itâ€™s also secure against known-plaintext attacks and
ciphertext-only attacks.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="kerckhoffs-principle">Kerckhoffsâ€™ principle</h4>
<p>The security of a cipher must rely only on the secrecy of the key,
and not on the secrecy of the algorithm. This principle was formulated
by Auguste Kerckhoffs in the 19th century, and itâ€™s still valid today,
because it allows the public scrutiny of the algorithms, and it allows
the development of secure ciphers, even if the adversary knows the
algorithm. This because is <strong>easier</strong> to keep a small key
secret, than a large algorithm secret: in case of a leak, changing the
key is easier (and cheaper) than changing the algorithm.</p>
<h4 id="security-trough-obscurity">Security trough obscurity</h4>
<p>The opposite of Kerckhoffsâ€™ principle is the <strong>security trough
obscurity</strong>, which is the reliance on the secrecy of the
algorithm, and itâ€™s a bad practice, because itâ€™s not reliable, and itâ€™s
not a good security measure. This is because the adversary can
reverse-engineer the algorithm, and find the key, and because the
algorithm can be leaked, and the security of the system is compromised.
This has been proved over the year: GSM/A1 were disclosed by mistake,
Enigma was broken by intelligence, and the DVD encryption was broken by
reverse-engineering.</p>
<h2 id="perfect-cipher">Perfect cipher</h2>
<p>In the hypothesis such that attacker isnâ€™t able to recover both some
plaintext and the key, a powerful intuition is, regardless of any <em>a
priori</em> knowledge, the ciphertext shouldnâ€™t reveal any information
about the plaintext.</p>
<h3 id="a-probabilistic-view">A probabilistic view</h3>
<p>Let a message <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> be a random
variable, with a probability distribution <span
class="math inline">\(P_M\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(P[M = &quot;attack today&quot;] = 0.7\)</span> and
$P[M = <span class="math inline">\(&quot;don&#39;t
attack&quot;\)</span>] = 0.3$ knew <em>a priori</em> by the attacker,
and let <em>Gen()</em> a probability distribution over the keys such
that <span class="math inline">\(P[K = &quot;key1&quot;] = P[k
\leftarrow\)</span> Gen()<span class="math inline">\(]\)</span>, with
<span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(K\)</span> independent. To generate the
ciphertext, we can use the following algorithm:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>choose a message <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> according to
<span class="math inline">\(P[M]\)</span>;</li>
<li>generate the key <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> according to
<span class="math inline">\(P[K]\)</span>;</li>
<li>compute the ciphertext <span class="math inline">\(c = E(k,
m)\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="definition-of-a-perfect-cipher">Definition of a perfect
cipher</h3>
<p>Itâ€™s clear that the ciphertext <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>
is a random variable <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, defined by
the encryption function <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>, so we
can formalize the concept of <em>information about plaintext</em> in
terms of probability distributions. A cipher is said to be
<strong>perfect</strong> if the ciphertext <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is independent of the plaintext <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(P[M = m |
C = c] = P[M = m]\forall m, c\)</span>. This means that the attacker
canâ€™t learn anything about the plaintext by observing the ciphertext. If
a cipher is perfect, itâ€™s said that itâ€™s <strong>perfectly
secure</strong>, and the necessary conditions for a cipher to be
perfectly secure are that the key must be chosen uniformly at random,
and that the key space must be at least as large as the message space,
as stated by Shannonâ€™s theorem.</p>
<h3 id="shannons-theorem">Shannonâ€™s theorem</h3>
<p>In a perfect cipher, the key space must be at least as large as the
message space. Speaking on mathematical terms, <span
class="math inline">\(|K| \geq |M|\)</span>. We can prove this by
contradiction:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>suppose that <span class="math inline">\(|K| &lt; |M|\)</span>,
which is the contradiction;</li>
<li>from the previous point, it must be true that <span
class="math inline">\(|C| \geq |M|\)</span>, because the cipher must be
invertible;</li>
<li>combining the two previous points, we have that <span
class="math inline">\(|C| &gt; |K|\)</span>;</li>
<li>now select <span class="math inline">\(m \in M\)</span> such that
<span class="math inline">\(P[M = m] &gt; 0\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(c \in C\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(E(k_i, m) = c \forall k_i in K\)</span>;</li>
<li>because of point 5, must exists al least one <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(c
\not ={c_i}\)</span>;</li>
<li>therefore, <span class="math inline">\(P[C = c | M = m] =
0\)</span>, that is a contradiction because the cipher is perfect, so
holds that <span class="math inline">\(P[M = m | C = c] = P[M = m] &gt;
0\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="perfect-indistinguishablity">Perfect indistinguishablity</h3>
<p>An encryption scheme <span class="math inline">\(\prod =
(G,E,D)\)</span> over <span class="math inline">\((K,M,C)\)</span> is
said to be <strong>perfectly indistinguishable</strong> if:</p>

<p>This means that the attacker canâ€™t distinguish between two plaintexts
by observing the ciphertexts: itâ€™s also true that <span

and only if itâ€™s perfectly secure.</p>
<h2 id="one-time-pad">One-time pad</h2>
<p>The one-time pad is a perfectly secure cipher, and itâ€™s based on the
following assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>let <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> be a t-bit message,
i.e.Â <span class="math inline">\(x \in \{0,1\}^t\)</span>;</li>
<li>let <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> be a t-bit key,
i.e.Â <span class="math inline">\(k \in \{0,1\}^t\)</span>, where each
bit is chosen uniformly at random;</li>
</ul>
<p>The encryption function <span class="math inline">\(E(k, x)\)</span>
is defined as the bitwise XOR between the message and the key, and the
decryption function <span class="math inline">\(D(k, y)\)</span> is
defined as the bitwise XOR between the ciphertext and the key.</p>
<h3 id="proof-for-xor-cipher">Proof for XOR cipher</h3>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> a random variable over
<span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}^t\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(K\)</span> a random variable over <span
class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}^t\)</span>, with <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(K\)</span> independent. Then, define <span
class="math inline">\(Y = X \oplus K\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(\oplus\)</span> is the bitwise XOR. We want to
prove that <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is uniformly
distributed over <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}^t\)</span>. The
proof, for <span class="math inline">\(t = 1\)</span>, is the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(P[X = 0] = X_0, P[X = 1] = X_1\)</span>,
such that <span class="math inline">\(X_0 + X_1 = 1\)</span>;</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(P[K = 0] = K_0, P[K = 1] = K_1\)</span>,
such that <span class="math inline">\(K_0 + K_1 = 1\)</span>;</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(P[Y = 0] = P[X = 0, K = 0] + P[X = 1, K
= 1] =\\= P[X = 0]P[K = 0] + P[X = 1]P[K = 1] =\\= X_0K_0 +
X_1K_1\)</span> = <span class="math inline">\(X_0\cdot 0.5 + X_1\cdot
0.5 =\\= 0.5 \cdot (X_0 + X_1) = 0.5\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="one-time-pad-has-a-perfect-secrecy">One-time pad has a perfect
secrecy</h3>
<p>The proof for the one-time pad is the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>from <strong>Bayesâ€™ theorem</strong>, we have that <span
class="math inline">\(P[M = m | C = c] = \frac{P[C = c | M = m]P[M =
m]}{P[C = c]}\)</span>;</li>
<li>from <strong>Total probability theorem</strong>, we have that <span
class="math inline">\(P[C = c] = \\ \sum_{i}^{|M|} P[C = c | M = m_i]P[M
= m_i] = \sum_{i}^{|M|} P[K = c \oplus m_i]P[M = m_i] =\\=
\sum_{i}^{|M|} \frac{1}{2^t}P[M = m_i] = \frac{1}{2^t}\)</span>;</li>
<li>substituting the previous point in the first one, we have that <span
class="math inline">\(P[M = m | C = c] = \\ P[K = c \oplus m] \frac{P[M
= m]}{2^t} = 2^{-t} \frac{P[M = m]}{2^t} = P[M = m]\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="one-time-pad-pros-and-cons">One-time pad: pros and cons</h3>
<p>The one-time pad has some pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>itâ€™s perfectly secure;</li>
<li>itâ€™s simple and efficient;</li>
<li>only one key maps a message <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>
to a ciphertext <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, it has some cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>the key must be as long as the message, so itâ€™s almost impossible to
use it in practice;</li>
<li>keys must be used only once, so they must be shared in advance, and
this is not always possible;</li>
<li>a known-plaintext attack is possible, because the key can be
recovered by XORing the plaintext and the ciphertext.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="one-time-pad-malleability">One time pad malleability</h3>
<p>A crypto scheme is said to be <strong>malleable</strong> if itâ€™s
possible to modify the ciphertext in such a way that the resulting
plaintext is related to the original plaintext. The one-time pad is
malleable, because if we XOR the ciphertext with a message, we obtain a
new ciphertext that decrypts to a message related to the original
message. A pratical example is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>suppose that Alice sends a message <span class="math inline">\(c = p
\oplus k\)</span> to Bob, and Eve intercepts the message;</li>
<li>Eve can modify the message by XORing it with another message <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, and send the new message <span
class="math inline">\(c&#39; = c \oplus r\)</span> to Bob, where r is a
<em>perturbation</em>;</li>
<li>Bob now receives the message <span
class="math inline">\(c&#39;\)</span>, and decrypts it to obtain \ <span
class="math inline">\(p&#39; = c&#39; \oplus k = c \oplus r \oplus k = p
\oplus k \oplus r \oplus k = p \oplus r\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The perturbation goes unnoticed, and can have a significant impact on
the plaintext.</p>
<h3 id="stream-ciphers">Stream ciphers</h3>
<p>The one-time pad is a stream cipher, and itâ€™s based on the concept of
a <strong>keystream</strong>: a sequence of bits that is used to encrypt
the message. The keystream is generated by a <strong>keystream
generator</strong>, which is a function that takes a key and a nonce,
and returns the keystream. The keystream is then XORed with the message
to obtain the ciphertext, and the same keystream is then XORed with the
ciphertext to obtain the message. The keystream generator must be a
<strong>pseudo-random generator</strong>, which is a function that takes
a seed and returns a sequence of bits that is indistinguishable from a
truly random sequence of bits. The keystream generator must also be
<strong>deterministic</strong>, which means that the same seed must
always produce the same sequence of bits.</p>
<p>When we refer to a <strong>pseudo-random generator</strong>, we
mean:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a deterministic algorithm that, given a truly random binary sequence
of length <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, called the
<strong>seed</strong>, produces a binary sequence of length <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, called the <strong>output</strong>,
such that the output is indistinguishable from a truly random sequence
of length <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If a pseudo-random generator has these two main properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>itâ€™s <strong>computationally secure</strong>, which means that it
must be computationally infeasible to distinguish the output from a
truly random sequence;</li>
<li>itâ€™s <strong>unpredictable</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>then is called <strong>cryptographically secure pseudo-random
generator</strong>. Formally, we can say that given a sequence of bit
<span class="math inline">\(s_i\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(s_{i+1}\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(s_{i+2}\)</span>, â€¦, <span
class="math inline">\(s_{i+n-1}\)</span>, itâ€™s computationally
infeasible to predict <span class="math inline">\(s_{i+n+1}\)</span> or,
in other words, doesnâ€™t exist an algorithm that can predict the next bit
of the sequence with a probability greater than <span
class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="case-study-802.11-wep">Case study: 802.11 WEP</h3>
<p>The Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is a security protocol for
wireless networks, and itâ€™s based on the RC4 stream cipher. Its
structure is the following:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/01/802.11.png" alt="RC4 structure" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">RC4 structure</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The key length is fixed to 104 bits, and the IV length is fixed to 24
bits; it can be settled with a counter, or with a random number. The IV
is concatenated with the key, and the result is used as the seed for the
keystream generator. The keystream is then XORed with the message to
obtain the ciphertext, and the same keystream is then XORed with the
ciphertext to obtain the message. During the years, WEP has been proved
to be insecure, because of the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>the key is too short and can be used more than once, and this can
lead to the recovery of the key. In particular, itâ€™s possible to recover
the value of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> in about <span
class="math inline">\(40&#39;000\)</span> frames.</li>
<li>the repetition of the IV after <span
class="math inline">\(2^{24}\)</span> frames, and this can lead to the
recovery of the keystream.</li>
<li><strong>CRC</strong>, used to check the integrity of the message and
chosen for its execution speed, is not secure and can be easily
forged.</li>
